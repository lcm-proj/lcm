lcm-spy - traffic inspection tool
.SH SYNOPSIS
.TP 5
\fBlcm-spy \fI[options]\fR

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBlcm-spy\fR is the Lightweight Communications and Marshalling traffic 
inspection utility.  It is a graphical tool for viewing messages received on 
an LCM network, and is analagous to tools like Ethereal/Wireshark and tcpdump
in that it is able to inspect all LCM messages received and provide information
and statistics on the channels used.

When given appropriate LCM type definitions, \fBlcm-spy\fR is able to
automatically detect and decode messages, and can display the individual fields
of recognized messages.  \fBlcm-spy\fR is limited to displaying statistics for
unrecognized messages.

\fBlcm-spy\fR collects the following statistics for each channel:
.IP - 2
Channel name
.IP - 2
Number of messages received
.IP - 2
Message Rate (Hz)
.IP - 2
Bandwidth (KB/s)

On its own, this information can often be used to verify that messages are
being transmitted on the expected channels, and at the expected data rates.

.SH OPTIONS
The following options are provided by \fBlcm-spy\fR
.TP
.B \-l, \-\-lcm\-url=\fIURL\fR
Use the specified LCM URL
.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
Shows some help text and exits

.SH AUTOMATIC MESSAGE DECODING

If a Java class generated by \fBlcm-gen\fR for an LCM type definition
is contained within a JAR file that is on the Java classpath,
\fBlcm-spy\fR automatically detects the class and uses Java reflection
to insert the corresponding LCM type definitions into a type database.
Subsequently, \fBlcm-spy\fR is able to automatically recognize and
decode messages received that correspond to all such types.
