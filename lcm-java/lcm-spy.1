.SH NAME
lcm-spy \- a traffic inspection tool
.SH SYNOPSIS
.TP 5
\fBlcm-spy \fI[options]\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
.nf

\fBlcm-spy\fR collects the following statistics for each channel:
.IP - 2
Channel name
.IP - 2
Number of messages received
.IP - 2
Message Rate (Hz)
.IP - 2
Bandwidth (KB/s)

.RE
On its own, this information can often be used to verify that messages are being transmitted on the
expected channels, and at the expected data rates.
.PP
usage: lcm\-spy [options]
.PP
lcm\-spy is the Lightweight Communications and Marshalling traffic
inspection utility.  It is a graphical tool for viewing messages received on
an LCM network, and is analagous to tools like Ethereal/Wireshark and tcpdump
in that it is able to inspect all LCM messages received and provide information
and statistics on the channels used.
.PP
When given appropriate LCM type definitions, lcm\-spy is able to
automatically detect and decode messages, and can display the individual fields
of recognized messages.  lcm\-spy is limited to displaying statistics for
unrecognized messages.

.SH "AUTOMATIC MESSAGE DECODING"

If a Java class generated by \fBlcm-gen\fR for an LCM type definition
is contained within a JAR file that is on the Java classpath,
\fBlcm-spy\fR automatically detects the class and uses Java reflection
to insert the corresponding LCM type definitions into a type database.
Subsequently, \fBlcm-spy\fR is able to automatically recognize and
decode messages received that correspond to all such types.
