GUI views for charts and traces.<p>

This package offers widgets that allow to react (show a view) 
on charts and traces. <p>

The implementations are kept minimal but some controls consist of several 
visible components. Therefore fixed layouting has to be done. In that 
case the widgets are intended for demonstration of chart / trace interaction 
only. <p>
