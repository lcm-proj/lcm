      <h2>Donations for JChart2D</h2>
      <p>
       JChart2D has been made for fun. It was originally written in fall of 
        2000 and put to the files. 
        In April 2002 i took the time to rewrite it, in the hope to share it with 
        the open source community. 
      </p>
      <p>
       It has to be pointed out, that JChart2D is free for everyone. 
       Nevertheless some effort and hours were spent to make it clean 
       and stable.
       If you are incredible rich or think that the effort on jchart2d should 
       be rewarded (or both) you are encouraged to donate money.
      </p>

       Just click the following link and follow the instructions.

       not introduce security issues.
