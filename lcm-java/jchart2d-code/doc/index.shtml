    <h2>What is JChart2D?</h2>
    <p>
     JChart2D is an minimalistic realtime charting library published under the OSI approved 
     <a target="_blank" href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.txt">GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</a>.
     It is designed for displaying multiple traces consisting of tracepoints. 
     JChart2D is centered around a single configureable swing widget: the Chart2D. 
     It is a JComponent one can add to a java swing user 
     interface. Therefore basic knowledge of java awt and swing and 
     the information provided on this site is helpful. If no basic knowledge of swing 
     and awt is given, the example code will give a quick entry as well. 
    </p>

    <h2>Why yet another charting library?</h2>
    <p>
     Many open source charting libraries are available. One list may be found at 
     <a href="http://java-source.net/open-source/charting-and-reporting" target="blank">http://java-source.net/open-source/charting-and-reporting</a><br/>
     Especially for the web in recent years many beautiful solutions based upon javascript / flash / sgml have 
     been created. Some are listed here:  
     <a href="http://www.webappers.com/category/components/charts/" target="_blank">http://www.webappers.com/category/components/charts/</a>
    </p> 
    <p>
     These solutions differ in purpose and ease of use. Some are especially intended 
     for business charting and therefore allow a lot of visual configuration and nice 
     designs. To state it in one sentence: JChart2D is intended for engineering tasks 
     and not for presentations. It's specialty is run time - dynamic precise display of 
     data with a minimal configuration overhead. 
    </p>
    
    <h2>Intended audience</h2>
    <p>
     Everybody may use JChart2D for free. Personally I would be very unhappy 
     if it would be used within a "homeland security" and "war on terrorism" 
     company. Even if it would be a technical honor to JChart2D as warfare 
     requires high precision and engineering qualities.
