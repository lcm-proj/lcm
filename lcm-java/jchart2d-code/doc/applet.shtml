       <h2>Demo Applet</h2>
      <p>
       This is a demo applet that shows a dynamic chart along with all recent 
       UI controls available. It prints summations of 
       random values [positive or negative] on the y axis and a timestamp on the x axis. 
       The y-axis has been forced to always show the range between -20 and +20. 
      </p>
      <p> 
       A message about an invalid digital signature will pop up. The applet uses a filechooser to 
       allow you saving a snapshot image to a location on your harddisk of your choice. 
       So the applet had to be signed. Please understand that I cannot to afford to pay a 
       CERTIFICATE AUTHORITY ("Trusted Third Party") organization to verify the signature. 
      </p>
      <p>
       The amount of points as well as the period in which a new point is added may be 
       chosen. The sliders allow values that should cause a high cpu load or weird labeling. 
       This is intended and allows to experiment with the effect of configuration and to 
       find good settings. The sourcecode may be viewed through the

        Ooops, you need a java plugin to show the applet. It's worth the short installation, 
        you will be able to see many other important applets (e.g. http://www.map24.de is a killer app for 
        your browser). <br>
        Download and install the Java Runtime Environment (includes the plugin): 
        <a target="_blank" href="https://cds.sun.com/is-bin/INTERSHOP.enfinity/WFS/CDS-CDS_Developer-Site/en_US/-/USD/ViewProductDetail-Start?ProductRef=jre-6u24-oth-JPR@CDS-CDS_Developer">Download J2SE JRE </a>. 
        Choose the <b>JRE</b> which is smaller, the SDK is only needed for developers.
