     <h2>Find help</h2>
      <p>
      Feel free to post your help requests here: <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/jchart2d/forums/forum/166411" target="_blank">https://sourceforge.net/projects/jchart2d/forums/forum/166411</a>.
      <br/>
      Please do not write emails to me personally. This wish ist not because I don't want to provide help. I just want to share knowledge and allow other users 
      also to provide help. 
      </p>
     <h2>Submit a bug</h2>
      <p>
       JChart2D was not tested with all operating systems, different virtual 
       machine implementations and API use-cases. Even if I think that it runs quite stable, 
       you may discover a bug. <br>
       If you do so, report it! Almost every new shipment of JChart2D and other projects 
       by me were triggered by bug reports. 
       Most often within a day or a delay to the next weekend. I made less than 10 shipments 
       for three projects.  
     </p>
      <p>
       Please improve JChart2D by posting your detailed bug report here:<br>

       Please include every information required [e.g. you code] to reproduce the bug.

     <h2>Why should I?</h2>
     <h3>The license</h3>
      <blockquote>
       "...if you incorporate code or algorithms from open source places, even 
        inadvertantly, you are going to infect the intellectual property rights 
        of what you are creating with the original code itself, depending on the 
        license terms."
      </blockquote>
      
      <p>
       I found this statement in a newsgroup. 
        The 
       <a target="_blank" href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/lgpl-2.1.php">LGPL</a> 
       indeed imposes restrictions if you modify the source of this library (that modified library 
       then has to be free and under LGPL). But why would someone do that? To fix a bug or add 
       a feature. If the library itself is only used by an application the LGPL does not affect 
       the license of the application (java is linked dynamically). To stay on the safe side 
       you should prefer reporting bugs instead of fixing them. Or even better: fix the bug, 
       report it and send the changes to the author. 
      </p>
      <h3>My interpretation</h3>
      <p>
       I don't want to be responsible for infecting someone's work with an "open source virus". 
       I don't want people to think of open source as a virus. I don't care if you do not follow 
       the LGPL. Users have to negotiate this with their conscience. 
      </p>
      <h3>Privacy</h3>
      <p>
       Users that report a bug or request a feature will remain anonymous to the public unless 
       they declare upon a potential request that they agree to let their name be 
       shown on some testimonial page in future. In ref-logs I've seen  
       visits from major companies that returned several times to this page 
       and stayed longer than 2 minutes. Don't be afraid, your contribution will be handled with 
       discretion.
