 udpm://
     UDP Multicast provider
     network can be of the form "multicast_address:port".  Either the
     multicast address or the port may be ommitted for the default.

     options:
         recv_buf_size = N
             size of the kernel UDP receive buffer to request.  Defaults to
             operating system defaults

         ttl = N
             time to live of transmitted packets.  Default 0

     examples:
         "udpm://239.255.76.67:7667"
             Default initialization string

         "udpm://239.255.76.67:7667?ttl=1"
             Sets the multicast TTL to 1 so that packets published will enter
             the local network.

 * @verbatim
 file://
     LCM Log file-based provider
     network should be the path to the log file

     Events are read from or written to the log file.  In read mode, events
     are generated from the log file in real-time, or at the rate specified
     by the speed option.  In write mode, events published to the LCM instance
     will be written to the log file in real-time.

     options:
         speed = N
             Scale factor controlling the playback speed of the log file.
             Defaults to 1.  If less than or equal to zero, then the events
             in the log file are played back as fast as possible.  Events are
             never skipped in read mode, so actual playback speed may be slower
             than requested, depending on the handlers.

         mode = r | w
             Specifies the log file mode.  Defaults to 'r'

         start_timestamp = USEC
             Seeks to USEC microseconds in the logfile, where USEC is given in
             microseconds since 00:00:00 UTC on 1 January 1970.  If USEC is
             before the first event, then playback begins at the start of the
             log file.  If it is after the last event, calls to lcm_handle will
             return -1.

     examples:
         "file:///home/albert/path/to/logfile"
             Loads the file "/home/albert/path/to/logfile" as an LCM event
             source.

         "file:///home/albert/path/to/logfile?speed=4"
             Loads the file "/home/albert/path/to/logfile" as an LCM event
             source.  Events are played back at 4x speed.

 memq://
    Memory queue test provider

    This provider is primarily useful for testing, especially unit testing code
    that uses LCM.  It provides a pub/sub interface that is private to the LCM
    instance, and does _not_ provide any interprocess communication, or even
    inter-instance communication.  Use this provider to implement unit tests
    that require deterministic and predictable behavior that is independent of
    a system's network configuration.

    example:
        "memq://"
            This is the only valid way to instantiate this provider.
