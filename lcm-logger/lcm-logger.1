.SH NAME
lcm-logger \- a logging tool
.SH SYNOPSIS
.TP 5
\fBlcm-logger \fI[options]\fR \fI[FILE]\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
usage: lcm\-logger [options] [FILE]
.PP
LCM message logging utility. Subscribes to all channels on an LCM
network, and records all messages received on that network to
FILE. If FILE is not specified, then a filename is automatically
chosen.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-channel\fR=\fI\,CHAN\/\fR
Channel string to pass to lcm_subscribe.
(default: ".*")
.TP
\fB\-\-flush\-interval\fR=\fI\,MS\/\fR
Flush the log file to disk every MS milliseconds.
(default: 100)
.TP
\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-force\fR
Overwrite existing files.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Shows this help text and exits.
.TP
\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-increment\fR
Automatically append a suffix to FILE
such that the resulting filename does not
already exist.  This option precludes \fB\-f\fR and
\fB\-\-rotate\fR.
.TP
\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-lcm\-url\fR=\fI\,URL\/\fR
Log messages on the specified LCM URL
.TP
\fB\-m\fR, \fB\-\-max\-unwritten\-mb\fR=\fI\,SZ\/\fR
Maximum size of received but unwritten
messages to store in memory before dropping
messages.  (default: 100 MB)
.TP
\fB\-\-rotate\fR=\fI\,NUM\/\fR
When creating a new log file, rename existing files
out of the way and always write to FILE.0.
If FILE.0 already exists, it is renamed to FILE.1.
If FILE.1 exists, it is renamed to FILE.2, etc.
If FILE.NUM exists, then it is deleted.
This option precludes \fB\-i\fR.
.TP
\fB\-\-split\-mb\fR=\fI\,N\/\fR
Automatically start writing to a new log
file once the log file exceeds N MB in size
(can be fractional).  This option requires \fB\-i\fR
or \fB\-\-rotate\fR.
.TP
\fB\-q\fR, \fB\-\-quiet\fR
Suppress normal output and only report errors.
.TP
\fB\-a\fR, \fB\-\-append\fR
Append events to the given log file.
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-strftime\fR
Format FILE with strftime.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-invert\-channels\fR
Invert channels.  Log everything that CHAN
does not match.
.TP
\fB\-\-disk\-quota\fR=\fI\,SIZE\/\fR
Minimum amount of free space to reserve on the disk
being written to. lcm\-logger will exit when it sees
the current free disk space has fallen below the
quota minimum.
For example, given `du \fB\-H\fR` reports 15 GB free, and
that nothing else is changing the target disk,
\fB\-\-disk\-quota\fR=\fI\,10GB\/\fR means that lcm\-logger will not
write more than 5 GB before it exits.
Units accepted: B
1024: K, M, G, T, P, E, Ki, Mi, Gi, Ti, Pi, Ei, KiB, MiB, GiB, TiB, PiB, EiB
1000: KB, MB, GB, TB, PB, EB
e.g. "50G" or "0.05 TiB".
Units are treated case insensitively. gb is treated
as GB (gigabytes) and not as gigabits.
Note for `df`: \fB\-h\fR is 1024 and \fB\-H\fR is 1000 units.
NOT currently supported on Windows!
.PP
Rotating / splitting log files
==============================
.IP
For long\-term logging, lcm\-logger can rotate through a fixed number of
log files, moving to a new log file as existing files reach a maximum size.
To do this, use \fB\-\-rotate\fR and \fB\-\-split\-mb\fR.  For example:
.IP
# Rotate through logfile.0, logfile.1, ... logfile.4
lcm\-logger \fB\-\-rotate\fR=\fI\,5\/\fR \fB\-\-split\-mb\fR=\fI\,2\/\fR logfile
.IP
Moving to a new file happens either when the current log file size exceeds
the limit specified by \fB\-\-split\-mb\fR, or when lcm\-logger receives a SIGHUP.
A user may send SIGHUP with the kill command to trigger rotating logs.
.SH SIGNALS
.PP
On platforms defining SIGHUP, lcm-logger will react to HUP by closing the
active log file and opening a new one.
