# Contributing Java

`lcm.jar` along with `lcm-spy` and `lcm-logplayer-gui` are built with Cmake. There is not a Ant/Maven/Gradle project.
 To edit the code, use your IDE of choice to create a project in the `lcm-java` folder. `lcm-java/lcm` should be the top level package (`lcm.lcm.LCM` is the fully qualified name for the `LCM` class). 
 
 To get the best results from Visual Studio Code, it may be necessary to first create an Eclipse project by using Eclipse.
