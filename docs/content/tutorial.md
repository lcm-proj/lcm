# LCM Introduction

LCM is a package designed to allow multiple processes to exchange messages in
a safe and high-performance way.   
A <em>message</em> is the basic unit of LCM communications: it represents a
self-contained piece of information.  Messages are defined as programming
language-independent data structures; the lcm-gen tool compiles these
definitions into language-specific code.

Each message is sent on a <em>channel</em>, which is identified by a
human-readable name. For example, messages containing information about the
temperature in the hallway might be published on the "HALLWAY_TEMPERATURE"
channel. By convention, all messages on a channel have the same type.

Any application can publish on any channel, although it is common for
a single application serves as the sole source of data on a channel. Any
application can receive data on any channel--- for example, both a thermostat
application and data logger might subscribe to the "HALLWAY_TEMPERATURE"
channel.

This tutorial will walk you through the main tasks for exchange messages
between two applications:

 - Create a type definition
 - Initialize LCM in your application
 - Publish a message
 - Subscribe to and receive a message

Since the type definitions are language independent, the [first step](tutorial-lcmgen.md) is the same
for all programming languages.  

 - [Step 1: Creating a type definition](tutorial-lcmgen.md)

The remaining steps vary across programming
languages, consult the following sections for language-specific tutorials.

 - [Steps 2-4: C](tutorial-c.md)
 - [Steps 2-4: C++](tutorial-cpp.md)
 - [Steps 2-4: C# / .NET](tutorial-dotnet.md)
 - [Steps 2-4: Java](tutorial-java.md)
 - [Steps 2-4: MATLAB](tutorial-matlab.md)
 - [Steps 2-4: Python](tutorial-python.md)
 - [Steps 2-4: Lua](tutorial-lua.md)
 - [Steps 2-4: Go](tutorial-go.md)

Note that C and C++ are considered to be separate programming languages.  It is
possible to use the C bindings from C++, but there are also LCM bindings
specific to C++.

Of course, serious projects will need a build system. LCM itself is built with
[CMake](https://cmake.org/), and provides helper functions to simplify the
binding generation process for projects built with CMake.

## Additional examples

Additional examples are provided with the source distribution of LCM.

For each language, at least two examples are provided. One listens for a
message, the other transmits a message. The LCM type used is defined in
[example_t.lcm](https://github.com/lcm-proj/lcm/blob/master/examples/types/example_t.lcm)  (`examples/types/example_t.lcm` in the source distribution).

Additional examples are distributed with the LCM source in the `examples/`
directory.
