LCM Documentation
=================

LCM is a set of libraries and tools for message passing and data marshalling, targeted at real-time
systems where high-bandwidth and low latency are critical. It provides a publish/subscribe message
passing model and automatic marshalling/unmarshalling code generation with bindings for applications
in a variety of programming languages.
