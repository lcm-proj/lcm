      share/lcm.jar as a symlink.

May 6, 2012
===========

Release 0.9.0

This release adds a constructor to the C++ API, some command line options to
lcm-logger, and incorporates a number of bugfixes.

- Java
    - workaround to accomodate recent changes in Automake.  In particular, fixes
      lcm-java for Ubuntu 12.04.
- C
    - add start_timestamp option to log file provider
    - fix multicast TTL issue #45
    - Fixes for fragmentation of larger messages.  Big messages were previously
      fragmented into 1400B packets. However, since lcm_udp uses a short for
      the number for fragments there can only be 64K fragments.  The makes LCM
      use the 1400B packet size if the message would be broken up in to less
      than 64K fragments. Otherwise it increases the packet size to split the
      message into 64K packets
- C++
    - Add a constructor to create a C++ instance wrapping arond an existing lcm_t
      C instance.
- Python
    - fixes to build in Windows using MS VS 2008.

      check LCM version from C/C++.
- C++
    - rename LCM::fileno() to LCM::getFileno()
      fileno is implemented as a macro on some platforms, and is thus
      effectively a reserved keyword.
- lcm-gen
    - C++ don't try to dynamically resize fixed-size arrays (re issue #42)
- Python
    - bugfix in decoding multivariable arrays
- lcm-logplayer-gui

      API reference.
- C
    - fix a minor memory leak in lcm_tcpq.c (closes issue #33)
- General
    - Switched documentation from GTK-Doc to Doxygen.  To build most documentation,
      run doxygen from the docs/ directory.  Java, C#, and Python API reference
      docs are still built separately.

Jun 9, 2011
===========

Release 0.6.0

This release includes a number of bugfixes and performance enhancements

- C
    - Change internal buffering from a fixed size ringbuffer to
      per-subscription FIFO queues.  Subscriptions start with a default maximum
      queue length of 30 messages, which can be adjusted using the new function
        `<message_type>_subscription_set_queue_capacity()`
      For example, to set the queue size to 5 for a message type example_t:

           example_t_subscription_t* subs = example_t_subscribe(lcm, "EXAMPLE", message_handler);
example_t_subscription_set_queue_capacity(subs, 5);

    - Explicitly disallow recursive calls to lcm_handle.
    - fix synchronization issues when allocating receive resources and
      conducting multicast self-test.  see issue #30

      addition to .jar files.
- lcm-gen

Jun 7, 2010
===========

Release 0.5.0

       contains the LCM type msg_t, then the `__init__.py` file now contains:

           from msg_t import msg_t

       and the recommended usage pattern is:

           import proj
           instance = proj.msg_t()

       see googlecode issue #21
    - (Windows, Java) fix pathname bug

- lcm-spy
    - remember last message on each channel so that object panels open up
   immediately.

Aug 14, 2009
============

Release 0.3.1

This is a maintenance release, and incorporates a number of minor bugfixes and
enhancements.

- Java
    - lcm-spy, lcm-logplayer-gui warn if gcj is detected as JRE
    - minor enhancements to lcm-spy
- Python
    - update comment docs

    - add --lcm-url=URL cmd line option to lcm-{spy,logger,logplayer,logplayer-gui}
    - updated examples

Jun 29, 2009
============

Release 0.3.0

- Java
    - Faster serialization classes that provide a 4x-5x speedup.  This introduces
    a backwards-incompatible change to the LCM Java API.  Specifically, the
    `messageReceived()` method of the LCMSubscriber interface has changed from:
        public void messageReceived(LCM lcm, String channel, DataInputStream ins)
   to
        public void messageReceived(LCM lcm, String channel, LCMDataInputStream ins)
   LCMDataInputStream has an almost identical API to DataInputStream, and
   migration of source code to the new API should only require changing
   implementations of LCMSubscriber in the manner described above.
- C
    - warn on Linux if large packets are being received but the kernel rbuf is
    small
- Python
    - bugfix for decoding arrays of bytes

Apr 15, 2009

===========

Release 0.1.1

- C
    - Modify "file://" provider so that lcm_handle returns -1 on EOF.
    - Suppress warning messages when event numbers in a logfile are not
    consecutive

Aug 29, 2008
============

Release 0.1.0

New features

- Added const declaration to .lcm specification.
- Removed transmit_only option from LCM URL.  All LCM instances are now
  considered transmit only until a channel subscription is made.
- Added LCM_DEFAULT_URL environment variable.  If the LCM URL is not specified
  during instantiation, and LCM_DEFAULT_URL is defined, then that is used as
  the LCM URL initialization string.
- Added documentation for LCM type specification language.
- Added close method to Java LCM class.

Deprecations

- enum is now deprecated in the .lcm specification.  Current implementations
  will be left functional, but enums will no longer be documented or supported
  in future releases.  At some point in the distant future they may be
  completely removed.  Use of const instead of enums is now recommended.

Bugfixes

- Java
    - fix enum types.  This breaks the API for compiled Java enum types.  Changed
    java enum value field from private to public so that raw numerical value is
    accessible.
- C
    - lcm_udp bugfix to eliminate a corner-case infinite loop.
    - add mutex to allow only one thread in lcm_handle at a time.

May 5, 2008
