Oct 24, 2012
============

 Release 0.9.1

 This is a bugfix and maintenance release.

 C:
   - update comment docs to describe start_timestamp option

 C++:
   - change ReceiveBuffer forward declaration to struct.  Fix MSVC error.

 C# / .NET:
   - lcm-dotnet: fix publishing fragmented messages
   - modify one of the c# examples so that it can be easily used to test
     fragmented messages (by increasing num_ranges)

 Java:
   - install jar file as share/lcm.jar, not share/lcm-x.y.z.jar with a
     share/lcm.jar as a symlink.
   - fix the export snippet to work with two bookmarks that were created out of
     order.  also make it default to selecting the beginning/end to bookmark if
     only 1 bookmark exists
   - expose flush() method in lcm.logging.Log

 lcm-gen:
  Python:
    - python encode checks fingerprints of nested types (re #47)
    - apply patch from tprk77 bugfix in __init__.py import generation. (re #50)
    - don't raise UnicodeError when decoding non-utf8 strings.
  Java:
    - apply patch from jamoozy to reduce eclipse compiler warnings. (re #49)

May 6, 2012
===========

 Release 0.9.0

 This release adds a constructor to the C++ API, some command line options to
 lcm-logger, and incorporates a number of bugfixes.

 Java:
  - workaround to accomodate recent changes in Automake.  In particular, fixes
    lcm-java for Ubuntu 12.04.
 lcm-c:
  - add start_timestamp option to log file provider
  - fix multicast TTL issue #45
  - Fixes for fragmentation of larger messages.  Big messages were previously
    fragmented into 1400B packets. However, since lcm_udp uses a short for the
    number for fragments there can only be 64K fragments.  The makes LCM use
    the 1400B packet size if the message would be broken up in to less than 64K
    fragments. Otherwise it increases the packet size to split the message into
    64K packets
 lcm-c++:
  - add a constructor to create a C++ instance wrapping arond an existing lcm_t
   C instance.
 Python:
  - fixes to build in Windows using MS VS 2008.

 lcm-logger:
  - add --auto-split-mb and --auto-split-hours options.

Jan 20, 2012
============

 Release 0.8.0

  - add new macros LCM_MAJOR_VERSION, LCM_MINOR_VERSION, LCM_MICRO_VERSION to
    check LCM version from C/C++.
 lcm-c++:
  - rename LCM::fileno() to LCM::getFileno()
    fileno is implemented as a macro on some platforms, and is thus effectively
    a reserved keyword.
 lcm-gen:
  C++:
    - don't try to dynamically resize fixed-size arrays (re issue #42)
  Python:
    - bugfix in decoding multivariable arrays
 lcm-logplayer-gui:
  add command line parameters to:
    - start logplayer with the log paused
    - filter out specific channels from being played back by default.


Oct 15, 2011

     - fix decoding of zero-length primitive arrays (re issue #38)
     - computeHash() omit parameter name if unused
     - don't #include a type's own header file for recursive types
     - fix memory leak in LCM::publish() (re issue #35)
     - inline methods for generated code
     - use static local variable for getHash() to reduce liblcm dependency of
       generated C++ code
     - #include <string> if a type has a string field

 of bugfixes and documentation updates.

 lcm-gen:
   - Added the -x / --cpp option, which generates native C++ language bindings.
     See examples/cpp for examples, and the documentation for a tutorial and
     API reference.

 lcm-c:
   - fix a minor memory leak in lcm_tcpq.c (closes issue #33)

 General:
   - Switched documentation from GTK-Doc to Doxygen.  To build most documentation,
     run doxygen from the docs/ directory.  Java, C#, and Python API reference
     docs are still built separately.


Jun 9, 2011
===========

 Release 0.6.0

 This release includes a number of bugfixes and performance enhancements

 lcm-c:
   - Change internal buffering from a fixed size ringbuffer to
     per-subscription FIFO queues.  Subscriptions start with a default maximum
     queue length of 30 messages, which can be adjusted using the new function
         <message_type>_subscription_set_queue_capacity()
     For example, to set the queue size to 5 for a message type example_t:
       example_t_subscription_t* subs = 
           example_t_subscribe(lcm, "EXAMPLE", message_handler);
       example_t_subscription_set_queue_capacity(subs, 5);
   - Explicitly disallow recursive calls to lcm_handle.
   - fix synchronization issues when allocating receive resources and
     conducting multicast self-test.  see issue #30

 lcm-logplayer-gui:
   - expose remote log player play and pause commands

 lcm-logger: 
   - bugfix when creating subdirectories for output files

 lcm-spy: 
   - bugfix when LCM URLs contain equal signs
   - searches directories on classpath for lcmtype .class files, in
     addition to .jar files.

 lcm-gen:
   Python
     - bugfix.  remove extraneous typename
     - Constructor initializes valid fixed-size arrays
     - initialize float, double to 0.0 instead of 0
   Java
     - now appends 'f' for const float
   General
     - flush stdout before failing on parse / semantic error

 General:
     - add example for using LCM with GLib event loop
     - add example program for using LCM with select()
     - minor updates to API documentation

   Make LCMTypeDatabase public
   LCM fragmentation: guard against receiving same fragment twice
   lcm.lcm.LCM: allow passing NULL or the empty string to the constructor to 
      explicitly specify default LCM provider.
   lcm.lcm.LogFileProvider: bugfix for write mode
   remove lcm.test.SlowLCMSubscriber

 lcm-gen:
   general
     warn if struct has 'int' member type instead of 'intN_t'
     add options --csharp-strip-dirs and --csharp-root-nsp
   Python - generate valid code on empty LCM type
            only emit new_parents in _get_hash_recursive if necessary

July 14, 2010
=============

 Release 0.5.1:

 This is a bugfix release, affecting only the Windows port.

 Windows:
 Fix lcmgen Visual Studio project file - missing emit_csharp.c
 Add a .NET tutorial and some some C# examples

Jun 7, 2010
===========

 Release 0.5.0:

 This release introduces experimental support for C# / .NET, provided by 
 Jan Hrbáček.  Bug reports and patches are greatly appreciated.

 This release also introduces a small python API change, and renames a program
 in windows.  

 Additional bugfixes are included.

 Windows:

 - The lcm-dotnet/ directory contains a publish-subscribe library for
   .NET applications.
 
 lcm-gen:
 - (C#) A new set of options are available for generating C# bindings
 - (Python) change __init__.py import statements.  If a package named 'proj'
   contains the LCM type msg_t, then the __init__.py file now contains:
     from msg_t import msg_t
   and the recommended usage pattern is:
     import proj
     instance = proj.msg_t()
   see googlecode issue #21
 - (Windows, Java) fix pathname bug

 Other:
 - minor build system bugfixes

Mar 11, 2010
============

 Updated documentation for single host use, to describe how to use LCM over the
 localhost interface.

 C:
 - fix leaking file descriptors
 - fix OS/X compile bug for lcm-example (missing #include <sys/select.h>)
 - simplify project include path requirements in Windows
 - update error checking, messages for single host use (Linux)

 Java:
 - expose encode/decode methods for advanced users

 lcm-gen:
  - (C) add --c-no-pubsub command line option to lcm-gen to generate C language
    bindings without a dependency on liblcm (useful if only the marshalling
    aspect of LCM is desired).
  - (Java) don't complain about default pkg if one is specified on cmd line.

 lcm-spy:
 - remember last message on each channel so that object panels open up
   immediately.
 - put frames in front when double clicked.

 Other:
 - remove manpage-specific GFDL copyright notices.

Jan 6, 2010
===========

 Release 0.4.0:

 This release introduces experimental support for Microsft Visual C++, provided

 Bug reports and patches are greatly appreciated.

 There are also a number of bugfixes in the Java port.  See the changelog for
 details.

Aug 14, 2009
============

 Release 0.3.1:

 This is a maintenance release, and incorporates a number of minor bugfixes and
 enhancements.

 Java:
 - lcm-spy, lcm-logplayer-gui warn if gcj is detected as JRE
 - minor enhancements to lcm-spy

 Python:
 - update comment docs

 Other:
 - add --lcm-url=URL cmd line option to lcm-{spy,logger,logplayer,logplayer-gui}
 - updated examples

Jun 29, 2009
============

 Release 0.3.0:

 Java
   Faster serialization classes that provide a 4x-5x speedup.  This introduces
   a backwards-incompatible change to the LCM Java API.  Specifically, 
   the messageReceived() method of the LCMSubscriber interface has changed
   from:

    public void messageReceived(LCM lcm, String channel, DataInputStream ins)

   to:
  
    public void messageReceived(LCM lcm, String channel, LCMDataInputStream ins)

   LCMDataInputStream has an almost identical API to DataInputStream, and
   migration of source code to the new API should only require changing
   implementations of LCMSubscriber in the manner described above.

 C
    warn on Linux if large packets are being received but the kernel rbuf is
    small

 Python
   bugfix for decoding arrays of bytes

Nov 9, 2008
===========

    Release 0.1.1:

    * C: Modify "file://" provider so that lcm_handle returns -1 on EOF.
      Suppress warning messages when event numbers in a logfile are not 
      consecutive
    * C: change uint8_t* to void* in lcm_recv_buf, lcm_publish, and 
      lcm_eventlog_t
    * lcm-logger: add option to log only channels matching a regex
    * lcm-gen: bugfixes in emitted Java code
    * lcm-gen: add -jdefaultpkg option for emitted Java code, changed default
      behavior.

Aug 29, 2008
============

    Release 0.1.0:

    New features

    * Added const declaration to .lcm specification.
    * Removed transmit_only option from LCM URL.  All LCM instances are now 
      considered transmit only until a channel subscription is made.
    * Added LCM_DEFAULT_URL environment variable.  If the LCM URL is not 
      specified during instantiation, and LCM_DEFAULT_URL is defined, then 
      that is used as the LCM URL initialization string.
    * Added documentation for LCM type specification language.
    * Added close method to Java LCM class.

    Deprecations

    * enum is now deprecated in the .lcm specification.  Current implementations
      will be left functional, but enums will no longer be documented or supported
      in future releases.  At some point in the distant future they may be 
      completely removed.  Use of const instead of enums is now recommended.

    Bugfixes

    * Java: fix enum types.  This breaks the API for compiled Java enum types.
      Changed java enum value field from private to public so that raw
      numerical value is accessible.
    * C: lcm_udp bugfix to eliminate a corner-case infinite loop.
    * C: add mutex to allow only one thread in lcm_handle at a time.

May 5, 2008
===========

    Release 0.0.5:

    * Fix minor issue in lcm-gen for parsing oddly formatted files 
      (those missing token delimiters at EOF)

      types.
    * fix VERSION bug in ac_python_devel.m4 (affects OS X)
    * Remove a DGC hack that skipped over log gaps > 0.25 seconds
    * Try to make JAR file only contain class files, by using build directory
    * make lcm-spy more robust to receipt of non-lcm autogenerated types

Mar 21, 2008
============

    Release 0.0.4:

    * Portability improvements.  Core functionality is now tested on FreeBSD,
      Mac OS X, Linux, Solaris 10, and cygwin.
    * Added command line tool lcm-logplayer
    * Renamed GUI lcm-jlogplayer to lcm-logplayer-gui
